pattern recognition to&#x20;



## Why machine learning

we cant write programs for all cases sometime due to excise ammount of cases&#x20;

* spam email classifier
* image classification
* data mining&#x20;





**Data Analysis**&#x20;

extract patterns and hidden information



**Data mining**

extra more hidden info which cant be extract using data analysis





## Applications of ML

recommendation engines

friends suggetions

chatbots





B2B ->



**retail / ecommerce**

* products sell more
* cost analysis
* same items together (associaiton base rule)
* tracking buy behaviours

**banking & finance**

* finding loan eligible profile for defaulter matching
* branches location & plans

**transportation**

* price surge at some time
* travel optimisation

**manufatercing**

* iot base senors in robotic sensors and analysic for anomolies
* predictive maintenacne (before things go wrong)

**twitter**

sentiment analysis to earn
