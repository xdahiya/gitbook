# Tensors

a container for numbers

tensor = n dimensinal array



**0D tensor / scaler**

single number&#x20;

ex - (2),(3)



`a = np.array(4)`

`a.ndim == 0`



**1D tensor / vector**

list of numbers

`a = np.array([1,2,3])`

`a.ndim == 1`

dimenion = axes = ranl

a is here a vector also with 3 dim



ex - record of a single student

this is a 1d tensor but 3d vector





**2d tensor / matrix**

collection of vectors

`mat = np.array([[1,2,3],[3,4,5]])`

`mat.ndim == 2`



ex - record of a all students



**`nd tensor`**



**`example of 3d tensors is nlp in grouup on sentenses`**



time series data is also example of 3d tensors





4d tensors example is image





5d tensor is video
