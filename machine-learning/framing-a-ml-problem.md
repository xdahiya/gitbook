modeling the problem in mathmatics terms&#x20;

like for increasing the profit of an orginsation we can make a mathematics problem to reduce churn rate from 4% to 3%&#x20;

now statement of more profit is changed into a mathmetical model form



decide type of probelem and possible solution&#x20;



how we use oltp and olap to get data and which data algo used etc decided



revisit Current solutions and use them and test

Getting data&#x20;

Matrics to measure&#x20;

Online Vs Batch?

check assumptions
