# Feature Engineering

The term feature engineering refers to the process of applying domain knowledge to data by generating features that transform the data to make it easier to understand and interpret

better for ml algorithms

## Feature Transformation

* missing values
* &#x20;handling categorical values (one hot encoding. / convert numerical into categorical)
* outliear detection and removal
* feature scaling (Standardization,Normalization)



## Feature Construction

create new features based on specific domain knowledge



## Feature Selection

&#x20; base on domain knowlege select specific features and coloumn to improve algorithm efficeicy



## Feature Extraction

build some new feature on base of domain knowledge
